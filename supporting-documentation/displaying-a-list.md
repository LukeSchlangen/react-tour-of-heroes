# Display a Heroes List

In this page, you'll expand the Tour of Heroes app to display a list of heroes, and allow users to select a hero and display the hero's details.

## Create Mock Heroes

You'll need some heroes to display.

Eventually you'll get them from a remote data server. For now, you'll create some _mock heroes_ and pretend they came from the server.

Create a file called mock-heroes.ts in the src/app/ folder. Define a HEROES constant as an array of ten heroes and export it. The file should look like this.
